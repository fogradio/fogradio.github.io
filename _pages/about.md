I’m Hangwei Zhang (张航玮), a fourth-year undergraduate student in the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering at Beihang University (BUAA). I will receive my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Jun. 2026. From Sep. 2022 to Feb. 2024, I was an undergraduate in the School of Physics at BUAA, before I transferred to my current major. Before entering university in Sep. 2022, I studied at the Middle School Attached to Northwestern Polytechnical University in my hometown, Xi’an, Shaanxi Proviece.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
