research_interest: |-
  My overall **research ambition** is to seek a principled **unity between AI and physics**. This vision spans three complementary aims:

  * **Build models that understand, interact with, and generate the physical world**, closing the loop between perception, control, and synthesis.
  * **Use mathematics and physical laws to analyze and guide model mechanisms**, turning theory into design principles for reliable and interpretable AI.
  * **Apply AI to concrete problems across the physical sciences**, delivering methods that are accurate, data-efficient, and experimentally useful.

  I currently focus on **Generative Models**, advancing their foundations and applications for high-fidelity, controllable, and physically grounded generation. I also have experience and interests in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), AI4Physics, 3D Vision, Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning Theory, and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

I’m **Hangwei Zhang (张航玮)**, a fourth-year undergraduate student in the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering at Beihang University (BUAA). I will receive my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Jun. 2026. Before major transfer, from Sep. 2022 to Feb. 2024, I was an undergraduate in the School of Physics at BUAA. Before entering university in Sep. 2022, I studied at the Middle School Attached to Northwestern Polytechnical University in my hometown, Xi’an, Shaanxi Proviece.

**<span style="color:red;">I am actively seeking a suitable PhD position for Fall 2026!!!</span>**
